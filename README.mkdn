Getting Started

To get started with the Resurrection Remix ® sources, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

How To Build Resurrection Remix ® ROM - Tutorial
--------

### Build Environment

- Operating system – Tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10 and 13.10 (64-bit)
- Terminal
- Decent hardware (minimum of at least a dual core CPU and 4 GB of RAM)
- Optimally have an SSD (standard mechanical drives work as well but slow down the process drastically)
- Must have required packages for building installed, I will list them further down

### Required Packages
Simply copy and paste this in a terminal window:

      sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential zip curl libc6-dev libncurses5-dev:i386 x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev:i386 libreadline6-dev:i386 libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 libgl1-mesa-dev g++-multilib mingw32 openjdk-6-jdk tofrodos python-markdown schedtool pngcrush libxml2-utils xsltproc zlib1g-dev:i386

Let that install and then proceed.

More copy and paste:

      sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libGL.so

### Getting the Source
- Make required directories
- Obtain repo binary
- Add repo binary to your path
- Give repo binary proper permissions
- Initialize empty repo
- Sync repo

Alright, so now we’re getting there. I have outlined the basics of what we’re about to do and broke them down as I know them. This is all pretty much going to be copy/paste so it’ll be fairly difficult to screw this up :)

##### Make directory for repo binary

      $ mkdir ~/bin

##### Add directory for repo binary to your path

      $ PATH=~/bin:$PATH

##### Download repo binary and place it in the proper directory

      $ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo

##### Give the repo binary the proper permissions

      $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

##### Create directory for where the RR repo will be stored and synced

      $ mkdir ~/RR
      $ cd ~/RR

##### Initialize the RR repo and download the manifest

      $  repo init -u https://github.com/ResurrectionRemix/platform_manifest.git -b kitkat1

##### Sync source

      $  repo sync

##### To build Resurrection Remix ROM

      $ cd ~/RR
      $ ./build-rr.sh
      
##### Instead of using the script, you can manually use these commands

      $  . build/envsetup.sh && brunch <device>
